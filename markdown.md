## Notes 

Some the content that I found important would definitely be texts such as ls documents, your folders will pop up and gives you the option to select a folder. For instance folders that popped up for me were 'My Music' 'My Pictures' and a couple others. So essentially being able to access folder from within intrigued me. Also downloading files while inside the terminal was cool but you do get anxious uploading and delted doc that you feel like should be there that's where I struggled after I got over that which took me awhile I found it to be kind of fun being able to have the ability to make changes to computer that will help me with learning along this journey.

 ### Importance of Editors
 
 I feel that having an editor is a benefit that every developer. Editors have syntax highlighting, extensions,and code completions while coding. This allows the developer to see mistakes that are being made and corrections that need to take place, this enables the developer to decrease time spent on assignment with that help. learning about differents editors varies on how you feel about each editor you come in contact with choosing the right editor will definitely increase your productivity.

#### Thoughts on tips

The information provided in the reading assessment gives you the ability to access and travel through the terminal effectively so that you can see and make changes when necessary changes such as updates, using the name of the content you want to download for instance NodeJS. The biggest part was figuring out how to access information using the terminal you are able to connect your windows OS to Unbuntu this makes it so that Unbuntu can communicate with both side.
