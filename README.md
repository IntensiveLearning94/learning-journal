# Tyler Lawson's Learning Journal

**About Me**

#### My name is Tyler Lawson 
I am 25 years old I joined the Air Force when I was 18. My job consisted of security over a wide variety of government assets. I also did law enforcement during my time in as well. My side training consisted of training individuals to maintain Air Force fitness standards personally coaching my co-workers. I've been in leadership roles encouraging new Airmen to keep faith especially when life gets hard. Beleive in yourself and always strive for success. I found that relationships built on the struggles you go through in life helped build a bond between the people I now call family. I chose coding as another way to build relationships with more people, while also building a stronger foundation to strive for a career that will help me succeed both personally and professionaly.

*Growth mindset to me is your ability to embrace new ideas. Being able to do this is very important especially when to grow and succeed in life. the best way to improve in anything you do is to fail. Fail over and over until you have come to the understanding that doing so is just the natural order of self improvement. There are people out there where things just come natural, and in my personal view this would be more damaging than someone who fails and finds a new way to complete a problem.*

I will add my notes here and write a paragraph about growth mindset
- Stay motivated by listening too speeches about success
- Maintain personal discpline by always staying on time or ahead
- Read alot, apply what you read as practice

I will add notes here
