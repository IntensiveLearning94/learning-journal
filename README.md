# Tyler Lawson's Learning Journal

**About Me**

#### My name is Tyler Lawson

*Growth mindset to me is your ability to embrace new ideas. Being able to do this is very important especially when to grow as a person. the best way to improve in anything you do is to fail. Fail over and over until you have come to the understanding that doing so is just the natural order of self improvement. There are people out there where things just come natural, and in my personal view this would be more damaging than someone who fails and finds a new way to complete a problem.*

I will add my notes here and write a paragraph about growth mindset
- Stay motivated by listening too speeches about success
- Maintain personal discpline by always staying on time or ahead
- Read alot, apply what you read as practice

I will add notes here
