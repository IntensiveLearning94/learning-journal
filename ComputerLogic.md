# Computer Architecture Logic 
        Notes

1. How information is represented inside the computer
2. 4 different tasks
3. storage
4. Processing
5. Earliest computers were made out of wood and metal

### What makes a computer a computer
The computer was originally designed to take control and speed up the way we think. which is pretty much what happens today but with more capabilities do to our advancement in the tech/engineering industry

software controls hardware
4 different tasks 
take input 
storage 
processing
output- text, photos, videos, games, vr, signals to control a robot.
They were used in the past to manipulate numbers
Types of input what the user does that makes the computer stores in its memory
Data and Binary
computers work on ones and zeros and play a big rule on how the computer works on the inside
More wires equals more bits which means they can represent more complex information.
Binary only works with two digits 0 and 1
Text images or sound 
can all be represented by a sequence of numbers

Great videos I enjoyed listening to them
